Convert a PPM ASCII (P3 magic number) image to a mapping of math problem
answers to pixel colors, formatted as csv so it can be printed as a spread
sheet.

Takes a problem mapping file and a ppm image file.

Problem file:
csv file, first line is instructions on how the problem answer maps to a problem key
example: "Ends with" : answer ends with 1 use color 1
The remaining lines are a key plus a list of problems that map to that key.

Run the script to produce the ppm, then load or paste the ppm in a spread sheet. Change column widths and heights for square pixels and the font to fit in the pixels.
